\title{Sample from a simulated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with time-dependent mean}
\format{
A data frame of 201 rows and 3 columns. The columns represent the
variables: \code{t} (time), \code{y} (observation) and \code{u} (input).
}
\usage{
Ornstein
}
\description{
The data was simulated using a standard Euler-Maruyama method.

The simulated process is governed by the SDE
#' dx ~ theta * (mu + u - x) * dt + sigma_x * dw

The parameters used for simulation were
theta = 2, mu = 0.5, sigma_x = 1.358, sigma_y = 1e-8

The simulation time-step was 1e-3, and observation time-step 1e-1.
The simulation was taken from t = 0..20
